## Libft is a reproduction of the standard library.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Tsunami-S/libft.git
```

### Usage
make = make libft.a containing all functions.
make [header name] = make mylibft.a that contains only the functions in its header.
Of course, you can put several libraries together.
